## Task 1
    # 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
    # 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers (add, sub,mul,division):
    # 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
firstInput = input("Enter First Number ")
secondInput = input("Enter Second Number ")

firstNumber = (int(firstInput))
SecondNumber = (int(secondInput))

# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers (add, sub,mul,division):
print("Addition       :", (firstNumber + SecondNumber))
print("Subtraction    :", (firstNumber - SecondNumber))
print("Multiplication :", (firstNumber * SecondNumber))
print("Division       :", (firstNumber / SecondNumber))
